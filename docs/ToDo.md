# ToDo

List of things I should still work on

## Documentation
- 

## Core

- Auth
  - other auth methods in NgRx
    - change user feature key to core_user (only have to change the feature key)

- Theme
  - integrate with ngrx for selected theme in the local storage
  - figure out how to do a `--success` color and a `--failure` color (use NgRx naming)

## Other

- Helm / Kubernetes
  - helmfile
  - k3s
  - 
- Ansible

- GitHub Actions
  - linting, testing, CI/CD

- Docker
  - Dockerfile for each host/mfe
  - docker-compose.yml for each host

- Jest
  - Testing 80% plus for everything that exists

- Cypress
  - Basic Tests with reusable login

- Create a non-MFE architecture using the libs
  - shared/spells
  - shared/spells-route

- mfe-spells should essentially just bring in spells-route and do nothing.
